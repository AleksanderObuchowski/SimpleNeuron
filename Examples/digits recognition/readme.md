## Digits recognition

This is a program written with [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)  designed to test the neural netwotk against the problem of digits recoginiton

In the directory there are csv file from [mnist](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) library contatining digits and their lables.

The csv files are too big to host on github so you need to download them form [here](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/)

 You can check how good is the newtork doing with different neuron configurations and learning rate
